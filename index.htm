        <!-- <br>Love can't be described.
        <br>It has no shape, it has no form.
        <br>Love is not an object.
        <br>Love does not conform.
        <br>
        <br>Love enters our lives
        <br>The moment we are born.
        <br>From the cradle to the grave,
        <br>Love's in everyone.
        <br>
        <br>Love burns like a candle
        <br>That sometimes flickers but never dies.
        <br>Love may be invisible,
        <br>Although it's right before your eyes,
        <br>
        <br>Love can leave you empty,
        <br>Love can make you whole.
        <br>Love can make or break you,
        <br>Love is in your soul.
        <br>
        <br>Love is in your heart,
        <br>Love is in your mind.
        <br>Love doesn't discriminate,
        <br>Love is always blind.
        <br>
        <br>Love is universal,
        <br>It encompasses the globe.
        <br>No matter where you are,
        <br>Love has a language all its own.
        <br>
        <br>Love is all around you.
        <br>There's plenty of love to spare.
        <br>You cannot see or touch it,
        <br>But love is everywhere.
        <br>
        <br>Love's the greatest power,
        <br>And yet it is so small.
        <br>Love's a gift from God
        <br>To be shared amongst us all. -->

<br>2)
<br>This part has 4 parts, I am answering them in sequence:
<br>Aanswer of part 1—> When we consider the wors case , then each unit of the n block and each node of b+- TREe is filled halfly. 
<br>This occupy 1/4 th of the the total occupancy hence giving 25% occupancy.
<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Answer of part 2 —> Nope,it’s not possible.
<br>when we split the n block unit , the first n/2 leaf pages are placed in one n block unit, the remaining goes to the 2nd n - block unit. hence, the order of every n block split is maintained . 
<br>Therefore, nodes are consecutive in the n blocks.
<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Answer of part 3 —> When we constuct a  reg b+- TREe, the sequentiality leaf pages might not be there and therefore in the worst case , it takes one seek per leaf page.
<br>When we try using the method of block at a time , we will be having minimum n/2 leaves for each n block., and hence we can read each of the n block in single seek, reducing the worst case by n/2.
<br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Answer of part 4 —> When the technique of redistribution is used among same block nodes, then they will not require any furthur seeks , but in regular b+- tree the seeks will be equal to the number of redistibution leaf pages.
<br>Hence, its very efficient with the above scheme , also the wort case occupancy is halved.
