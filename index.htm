        <br>Love can't be described.
        <br>It has no shape, it has no form.
        <br>Love is not an object.
        <br>Love does not conform.
        <br>
        <br>Love enters our lives
        <br>The moment we are born.
        <br>From the cradle to the grave,
        <br>Love's in everyone.
        <br>
        <br>Love burns like a candle
        <br>That sometimes flickers but never dies.
        <br>Love may be invisible,
        <br>Although it's right before your eyes,
        <br>
        <br>Love can leave you empty,
        <br>Love can make you whole.
        <br>Love can make or break you,
        <br>Love is in your soul.
        <br>
        <br>Love is in your heart,
        <br>Love is in your mind.
        <br>Love doesn't discriminate,
        <br>Love is always blind.
        <br>
        <br>Love is universal,
        <br>It encompasses the globe.
        <br>No matter where you are,
        <br>Love has a language all its own.
        <br>
        <br>Love is all around you.
        <br>There's plenty of love to spare.
        <br>You cannot see or touch it,
        <br>But love is everywhere.
        <br>
        <br>Love's the greatest power,
        <br>And yet it is so small.
        <br>Love's a gift from God
        <br>To be shared amongst us all.
